<summary><strong>Why this retains</strong></summary>

ThriveMap is designed around a repeatable behavioral loop:

**Define → Rehearse → Track → Reflect**

This loop supports daily engagement, weekly completion, and long-term identity reinforcement.

AI increases perceived value over time by extracting patterns from user-generated reflection data without replacing the practice.

## Theme System — Night Ritual

ThriveMap’s visual system is built on a deep indigo foundation inspired by my iterative exploration inside  
[PixelBot by T.D.](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-zCVkaCE5X-pixelbot-by-t-d).

I didn’t want this to feel like another productivity dashboard.

I wanted something calmer. More immersive. Something that feels intentional when you open it at night reflective, focused, and slightly cinematic.

The goal isn’t visual noise.  
It’s quiet clarity.

Dark gradients create depth.  
Mint highlights signal progress.  
Purple undertones add warmth without becoming loud.

The result feels less like “task management” and more like a nightly ritual for alignment.

## Accent Logic

|----------------------|-------------|
| Active / Complete    | `#88EAB2`   |
| Progress / Today     | `#88EAB2`   |
| Informational / Tag  | `#8B759C`   |
| Muted / Disabled     | `#9A9BA3`   |

Mint always signals forward movement. Never decoration.
