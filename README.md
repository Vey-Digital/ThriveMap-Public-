<details>
<summary><strong> Why this retains</strong></summary>

ThriveMap is designed around a repeatable behavioral loop:
Define → Rehearse → Track → Reflect.

This loop supports daily engagement, weekly completion, and long-term identity reinforcement.
AI increases perceived value over time by extracting patterns from user-generated reflection data without replacing the practice.

## Status

This repo is a **public prototype** used to test UX flows, copy, and visual layout.


## Built for Every Device. 
ThriveMap runs on React Native and Expo, which means it works seamlessly across iOS, Android, and web. Whether someone is using a compact phone or a larger display, the experience stays consistent and intentional.
The interface adapts intelligently through:
• Smart safe-area handling for edge-to-edge screens
• Responsive spacing and adaptive typography for smaller devices
• Flexible layouts without rigid pixel constraints
• Careful testing across common breakpoints, from small Android devices to iPhone SE and larger iPhone or Pixel screens
