## Why it helps during hard seasons

When someone feels:

- Burned out  
- Laid off  
- Disconnected  
- Uncertain about relationships  
- Afraid of moving  

ThriveMap provides a simple loop that helps restore direction:

1. **Imagine** a best-possible future (guided)
2. **Write** with clarity and detail
3. **Visualize** daily for consistency
4. **Track** progress to reinforce momentum

- **1-minute imagine + 5-minute writing** per domain  
- **7-day visualization rotation**
